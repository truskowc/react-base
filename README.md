# React Base Project
This is intended to be the starting point of a new React application

## Installation

### 1. Using git, clone the repo (if not already done)
### 2. Install the depencdencies to the project

Simply run the following command in the root of the project folder to install all dependencies for the project. This results in the node_modules folder being installed:

```
npm install
```

### 3. Run the project

To start the development server, everything should be automatically opened and ready to go, the script will run actively in console and listen for changes in the code:

```
npm run start
```

### 4. Issues/Troubleshooting

Some common issues:

```
1. Wrong node version. I am using 17.0.1. NVM could help here.
2. Blow away package-lock.json and your node_modules and try to install again.
3. StackOverlow is your friend :).
